                    <h2>My Obsession with the Sky</h2>
                    <h5>Septempber 24, 2025 by Shanel</h5>

                    <p>Honestly, I don‚Äôt have an exciting story about how I started liking the sky‚ÄîI just do ü§∑üèæ.
                        There‚Äôs something so calm, peaceful, and beautiful about it. Even now, I still love pointing out the 
                        funny shapes the clouds make. I find comfort, and even joy, in just looking up.
                        What I love most is taking pictures of the sky‚Äîcapturing its subtle movements and freezing them in time, 
                        almost like keeping proof of how it looked on a particular day. Sunrise, sunset, cloudy skies, or even a 
                        clear, empty blue‚ÄîI find them all beautiful. There‚Äôs just something about that blue hue that I can‚Äôt get enough of.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It‚Äôs not just me there are so many people out there who love the sky and find even more ways to enjoy it than I do 
                        with my pictures. You have the adrenaline junkies who go paragliding or parachuting, and I‚Äôm sure even astronauts 
                        have a thing for the sky. Then there are people who worship it, astrologers who read the stars, and of course, the 
                        zodiac signs (Go Virgos!).
                        A beautiful sunset might mean something completely different to someone else, but at the end of the day, we both find
                        meaning in the sky and probably love it just as much. I‚Äôm also glad I get to enjoy the variety of the tropical sky‚Äîso 
                        many colors and moods because some people only ever get one kind of sky. Imagine living in a place with no 
                        night sky‚Ä¶ oh lord.

                    <h2>Computing and the Sky</h2>
                    <h5>September 24, 2025 by Shanel</h5>
                    <img src="anothersky.jpg" alt="photos of the sky" class="nextimg">
                    <p>The sky is a lot like computing. Just as the sky is always there‚Äîwhether clear, 
                        cloudy, at sunrise, or at sunset, computing is always present in our lives, constantly 
                        changing its ‚Äúmoods‚Äù and appearances.
                        Like clouds that shift into different shapes, computing takes many forms: from simple 
                        calculations to complex systems, from apps to networks. Both are vast, ever-changing, 
                        and full of possibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>And just like how we all find different meanings in the sky‚Äîwhether through pictures, 
                        paragliding, or astrology, people also find different purposes in computing. Some use 
                        it for work, others for creativity, exploration, or even just enjoyment.
                        In the end, both the sky and computing are about perspective. What you see‚Äîor what you
                        do with it‚Äîdepends on how you choose to look at it.
